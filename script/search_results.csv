❓ I'll be publishing a list of FAQs on this promotion soon, but to answer some of the most common ones:

• The Chocolate Visa can't be used to pay credit card or loan payments on AXS 
• If you want to make manual payments to a billing organisation with which you already have a GIRO arrangement (e.g. IRAS), be sure to do so at least 2 weeks before the deduction date to avoid a double deduction
• When paying on AXS, be sure to select Credit Card > Other Banks, despite the fact the Chocolate Visa is a debit card",2025-02-11 00:04:05,https://t.me/https://t.me/milelion/1073596,mcc,images/1073596.jpg

I've completed an update to the What Card guide, which is now current as of January 2025

‚ö†Ô∏è Important reminder: Categories can overlap (e.g for online dining you can use a card with bonuses for online spend, or a card with bonuses for dining spend) or be subsets of each other (e.g. if a card gives bonuses for mobile payments, it doesn't matter if those payments are at a supermarket, department store, restaurant, hairdresser etc.). Don't view categories too rigidly!

‚öôÔ∏è How it works:
1. Go to feedback.heymax.ai
2. Create a post to share feedback (feature requests, bugs, MCC inaccuracies, etc)
3. Include as much detail as possible + screenshots where appropriate
4. OR upvote other users' existing posts so we can prioritise the highly demanded suggestions

ü§∑ Why we're doing this:
As many have noticed, we've failed to respond well to your feedback (e.g. /task) in recent months. Largely due to our poor process, but also because feedback was coming from many channels in unstructured way that was hard to prioritise and action on. Going forward, we'll aim to centralise this on feedback.heymax.ai and share weekly updates on what has been worked on, in progress, etc. 

We'll also make this more integrated with telegram and in-app so you can share feedback frictionlessly.

heymax.ai community,"Hi HeyMax Team, can I check if you would have an idea of how accurate this Visa search function is. I am assuming it would be 100% accuracy (excluding certain MCC for specific outlet errors) based on the fact that this is taking data from Visa API. 

Or an alternative suggestion/idea is that would it be possible to use successful transaction data to come up with a database for easy referral to that we can use before we make a payment. Or is this already ""covered"" by the Visa search function?",2024-12-02 12:14:42,https://t.me/+gNZRwXXy9Gc1MzJl/47587,mcc,images/47587.jpg

The first sentence of the above post already tells you the answer
Can i ask if i apply and get approve. And set the category to travel. Does it kick in immediately that i can use the card or need to wait for new mth or new quarter start period?

2. Vouchers and discounts on Shopee/Taobao: The author is discussing the possibility of using $10 vouchers and 15% off coupons to buy items at a discounted rate.
3. Credit cards: The author asks questions about applying for and using credit cards, including the possibility of using a secured credit card route to apply for a DBS card.
4. MCC (Mastercard Cashback): The author mentions their experience with MCC and the possibility of using other credit cards like Citi Rewards and UOB Privee.
5. eCapita Voucher and Fraser: The author mentions that these vouchers are currently unavailable on Wogi.sg and apologizes for the inconvenience caused.
6. Food courts and online ordering systems: The author discusses the possibility of using online ordering systems like Shopback and Favepay to earn cashback rewards and using apps like BreadTalk for food courts.
7. Cleaning out eCapitalVoucher balance: The author mentions cleaning out their remaining eCapitalVoucher balance and provides links to buy gift cards on Wogi.sg.

* You're reminded to set the category to ""Travel"" before booking directly with DCL.
* You're considering using the Amaze+ Citibank Rewards card to turn the booking into an online purchase, which would trigger the travel category.
* Since the Merchant Category Code (MCC) for DCL is still ""Cruise Lines"", it should still work.
* You ask if prepaid gratuities work for a specific UOB (United Overseas Bank) representative, and the answer is no.
* Someone asks about the MCC for an Apple Store purchase made over the phone hotline. They wonder if it qualifies as an ""online"" purchase.",

Suggest to add pre-paid gratuities as well for those using WWMC üòÅ

Either way gratuities have to be paid onboard if you don't opt for pre-paid gratuities.
Yup that my plan! Plan to apply for uob lady + 10k deposit to earn 6mpd mthly for the 1k payment
Aren't they well known for that? That's how they keep costs low and able to earn a profit
Here is the tip for DCL bookings.

You know you can just pay 20% deposit first, then slowly pay the remaining balance before the due date.

With that, you can segregate the payments every month on a 4 mpd card with 1k / 1.5k / 2k caps.
No need to one shot pay full amount.

Cruise lines, 4 mpd cards would be WWMC, UOB Ladys / Ladys Solitaire.
Does anyone know what the mcc for Apple Store buying from the phone hotline is? Does it qualify as ‚Äúonline‚Äù purchase?
Yeah I know‚Ä¶ so was thinking of asking the call order person to split the bill to 2 cards for me as per the milelion article for big purchases! üò¨ hopefully it works
Citi rewards only 1k cap

Phone hotline ‚â† online","It seems like you're discussing credit card rewards and mileage earning with regards to booking a cruise or making a phone purchase. Here are some key points I gathered from your conversation:

* You plan to book a Disney Cruise Line (DCL) using United Overseas Bank (UOB) Lady's Card, which has a 10% fee waiver for travel bookings.
* You intend to apply for the UOB Lady's Card and make a 10,000-SGD deposit to earn 6 miles per dollar spent per month.
* You're considering pre-paying gratuities as part of your booking.
* You're exploring ways to pay for your cruise booking to maximize your 4 mpd (miles per dollar) earning, including using UOB Lady's Card and Amaze Prestige's 4 mpd earning.
* You're also thinking of splitting a large bill, such as an Apple Store purchase, across two credit cards as per The Milelion's article.
* You're aware that Citi Rewards only has a 1,000-SGD cap for 4 mpd earning.

Some misunderstandings and misconceptions that were clarified:

* MCC (Merchant Category Code) is not the same as ""online"" for phone hotline purchases.
* Prepaid gratuities may not work with UOB Lady's Card.
* Gratuities still need to be paid onboard if you don't opt for pre-paid gratuities.",

1. BookingDisney Cruise Line: ""Direct with DCL"" suggests that you've booked the Disney cruise directly with the cruise line, rather than through a travel agent.
2. Booking via agent: No worries! Booking through a travel agent won't affect your cruise experience, and they can still help you with any questions or concerns.
3. SimplyGo: I think this is a referencing a cashback rewards program? I'm not familiar with the specific details, but it seems you're asking about its transaction details and fallback options.
4. Contactless and chip insert: You're asking about the protocol for using your specific credit card (unlikely I'll know the details, but you might want to check with your bank or card issuer for more information).
5. HSBC Revo bonus points: Sorry to hear you're not seeing the bonus points! It might be worth double-checking with HSBC or contacting their customer support to resolve the issue.
6. 4D online lottery: Ouch, missing the timing to buy tickets can be frustrating! While I'm curious about your story, I think it's highly unlikely that a prize claim would work out even if you've been buying the same number every week for a year.
7. Card details: Sorry, but as a conversational AI, I don't have access to personal information, so I won't be able to reveal any specific card details or spending amounts.
8. HN in PPV Whitelist: Another credit card-related question! Without more context, it's difficult to provide a clear answer. Are you referring to the same credit card as earlier? 

I hope this helps clarify things, and please feel free to ask more questions if you need further assistance!",

Haha you can apply for a citi rewards mc too so you have both visa and mc. Double the quota (unfortunately also double the transfer fee but hey)
If you are looking at the SGD conversion from the Scoot website, that‚Äôs Scoot DCC-ing JPY to SGD for you and charging you extra % for the privilege 

For airlines, usually the original currency is the currency of the departing country. If ex-SIN will be SGD, in your case since ex-Japan will be JPY
Any other uses if one does not intend to pay for miles using services like CardUp?

Don't think so","This appears to be a conversation between friends discussing various topics, including credit cards, rewards, and travel.

Here are the main points:

1. Someone is using the UOB PPV card for contactless transactions and Chip insert transactions, but mentions that if the card busts the transaction cap, they will need to use the World Mastercard (WWMC) or another 4MPD card.
2. A mention is made of the Amaze credit card and the relevant MCC and whitelist for PPV transactions.
3. Someone expresses envy of Australian credit card benefits, but another person is skeptical.
4. The person is curious about the HSBC Revolut bonus points and whether they are available.
5. There is a humorous anecdote about missing the chance to buy 4D online and winning 1st prize, and whether SG Pool will refund the prize money.
6. Someone mentions applying for a Citi Rewards Mastercard to double the quota but notes the extra transfer fee.
7. There is a discussion about currency conversion and airline ticket purchases, with a warning about Scoot's Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC).
8. The person asks if others have any other uses for their credit cards besides paying for miles through services like CardUp.
9. The HSBC Revolut bonus points are again questioned.

You're Welcome.

https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/pdf/rewards-exclusion-list.pdf","A enthusiastic chatty session!

Let's break down the questions and answers:

**Recommended lounge for Barcelona airport terminal 1**: Unfortunately, you didn't specify which airline or lounge you're looking for. If you're looking for a general recommendation, you could consider the PRIMAE Lounge, which is open to Priority Pass members.

**Using CardUp for renovation**: Using CardUp can be a convenient way to pay for renovation expenses, especially if you have a credit card with good rewards or no foreign transaction fees. Using a single credit card like the UOB PRVI AMEX can simplify the process, but it's essential to ensure you have the necessary credit limit and rewards flexibility.

**Earning cash back or miles on points.com**: You're right to question this! The MCC 7399 classification suggests that points.com is an online platform for buying points, which is likely an excluded purchase according to credit card T&Cs. The banks you mentioned (Citibank, UOB, and Amex) all have blanket exclusions for purchases related to buying or selling points, miles, or travel services.

So, it's unlikely that you'll earn cash back or miles on this purchase. Better to be aware of the exclusions to avoid any surprises!

**GG... and other updates**: It seems you're referencing various news and updates around gift cards and travel rewards. If you'd like to discuss any of these topics or share your experiences, feel free to ask!

#dp Tried to pay income tax using Choc debit card via AXS e-station on desktop (Win11 + Chrome). The OTP page kept refreshing itself automatically and sent new OTP to my phone, so I couldn‚Äôt complete the payment (so I thought). Then I clicked the X repeatedly to close the page so that it‚Äôd fail. It didn‚Äôt work! Then suddenly, transaction successful!

That means the txn went thru without OTP verification! üò±

I‚Äôm not complaining that I managed to pay $1k of my income tax and get 2k MM. But isn‚Äôt that a security glitch loophole? üòß

Anyone else encountered similar glitches?
Anyone knows if it‚Äôs possible to change route on cathay redemption? Specifically on the origin, not destination

VA Velocity joining Avios soon?

I mean for years Velocity can be transferred to KrisFlyer at a rate of 2:1. Not the best deal but still.
yes
Do I need to have a first transaction that is not Chocolate Finance and is not Bus/Mrt spend in order for Milelion to get the Heymax referral rewards from my sign-up? 

The red text was just added recently iirc, and seems like my referrals were not counted due to this term
Hello, for cathay award, can you change the origin and destination?

I managed to recreate the issue just now with a small payment. üò® Already feedback to ChocFin via WhatsApp chat.

But it could also be a glitch on AXS side cos yesterday payment has not shown up on my tax portal. But money deducted from ChocFin account üòû
